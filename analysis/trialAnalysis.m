% Variables that MUST be changed by user:

%   T           Lenght of observational interval (in sec)
%   direc       Name of the directory where the spike trains are stored and 
%               where all the results of EM estimation will be stored by the subroutines
%   name_data   Name of the data file which contains the times of spikes     
%   R           Number of unit pulse functions (hence number of hidden processes (theta_1, .., theta_R).
%               This code assumes that the pulse functions have equal size.
%   lags        The history bins of spike-history component (a matrix of two columns)
% time_start, time_end: for each trial the state-space model will be fit
%               to the period (time_start,time_end]. Time_start must be
%               >=total spike-history and time_end must be <=T.
% period_start  Start of the period (in sec) for which the user wants to estimate 
%               the expected number of spikes (for each trial). Must be
%               bigger than the total spike history. 
% period_end    The end of the period (in sec) for which the user wants to estimate 
%               the expected number of spikes (for each trial). Must be
%               bigger than the total spike history. Can be less than T.
% period_start, period_end: The beginning and end of the period for which user wants to estimate the expected
%               number of spikes for each trial (in sec). Period_start must be > the total spike history; 
%               period_end must be <=T.
% period1_start, period1_end; period2_start, period2_end = two periods for
%               which user wants to compare the firing rates.

% Variables that CAN be changed by user (but do not have to):
%   stop_theta  convergence criteria for the initial theta (denoted as theta_0 in the paper). 
%               EM algorithm runs forward and backward several times until convergence is
%               accomplished or maximum of iterations is reached (see 'pom_theta_imax')
%   pom_theta_imax = Maximal number of iterations to estimate the initial theta
%   stop_abs    Abstolute stopping criteria for EM. The EM iterations stop
%               if absolute change in consecutive iterates for all parameters is less than stop_abs
%   stop_rel    Relative stopping criteria for EM. THe EM iterations stop
%               if relative change in consecutive iterates for all parameters is less then the stop_rel value.
%   n_iter1, n_iter2 Maximal number of EM iterations used (if the convergence criteria are not met). 
%               If the convergence criteria are not met then a warning will be printed on screen. 
%               Then the user needs to increase max number of iterations or make the stopping criteria less stringent.
% alphaa        The significance level for the stat inference.
%   Mc1         Number of Monte Carlo simulations to calculate standard errors 
%   Mc2         Number of Monte Carlo simulations to do stat inference for expected number of spikes.
   
% Variables that user should NOT be reset by user:
%   The time resolution delta is set to 1msec. It can not be changed.
